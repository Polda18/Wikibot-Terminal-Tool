# Source code maintainance and development documentation
Open-Source command line terminal tool called _Wikibot Terminal Tool_ is a project from community for community. I am a Wikipedia editor and programmer, so I made a program for an easy wikibot maintainance (could be easier using GUI - this is next goal, now using command line). This documentation site is made for programmer who would like to contribute to the project, or fork the project for their own development. Here you can find useful informations for easier development.
