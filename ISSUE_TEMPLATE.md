# Sending issues
To send an issue (bug) report, simply use `Issues` tab in the repository on GitHub. Always describe your issue as accurately as you can,
including ways to reproduce the bug. In some cases, additional informations about your system configuration would be required:
* Your operating system, full identification (OS brand, distribution, version, build)
* Your CPU, sometimes GPU setup (CPU/GPU brand, model, firmware)
* Your RAM size
* etc.

An issue without required information may be rejected.
